```{r}
prod_default <- read_csv(
    here::here('data', 'org_data_default.csv')
  )

prod_default %>% 
  mutate(
    levels = c(
      # Brand
      "Hydroflask",
      "Conmigo",
      "Nalgene",
      "Camelbak",
      # Lid Type default = Screwcap

      "$24.99",
      "$29.99"
    )
  ) %>% 
  rename(
    prod1_value = org1_value,
    prod2_value = org2_value,
    prod3_value = org3_value,
    prod4_value = org4_value 
  )
